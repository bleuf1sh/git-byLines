# git-team-tag
## Simple and responsive Git addon to capture all contributers in a commit message requiring no  special commands
copy/paste this line into terminal (bash) and run
```
UPDATE THIS
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bleuf1sh/setup-dev-mac/master/setupBase.sh?$(date +%s)" > setupBase.sh && bash setupBase.sh start
```


## What makes this different than other approaches out there?
There are no specific commands to remember or configurations to setup before use. 
The code is activated upon any "git commit" command within any git repo.

## How does it work?
git-team-tag overloads the git command via shell alias.
